# Security Policy

## Scope
MedNode is intended for healthcare interoperability workflows and will eventually handle sensitive operational contexts.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Until a dedicated security inbox is created, open a private security advisory in GitHub (preferred).  
If that is unavailable, contact maintainers directly through repository ownership channels.

## Disclosure Process
1. Acknowledge receipt within 72 hours.
2. Triage severity and affected components.
3. Coordinate remediation and test fixes.
4. Publish a disclosure notice after a patch is available.

## Supported Versions
No stable release yet. Security fixes currently apply to the default branch during pre-release development.
